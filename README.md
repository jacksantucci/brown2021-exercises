Classroom exercises to accompany <a href="https://collegepublishing.sagepub.com/products/statistics-and-data-visualization-using-r-1-262526"><i>Statistics and Data Visualization Using R: The Art and Practice of Data Analysis</i></a> (Brown 2021, SAGE Publications). The text comes with code to work mostly in the Tidyverse package collection. These exercise use base R instead, insofar as possible.
